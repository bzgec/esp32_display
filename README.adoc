=== Installation
==== KiBot
link:https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kibot#installation-using-pip[Installation]:

* `pip install --no-compile kibot`
(on Windows you probably need to install it in `KiCad Command Prompt`)

* On Arch Linux you can install it with: `paru -S kibot-git`
** You may need to install `pcbdraw-git` in case of
`module 'pcbnew' has no attribute 'PLOTTEXTMODE_STROKE'` error
(try to run `pcbnew --version` to be sure that program runs correctly)

==== recordmydesktop
* Needed only if running `kibot -vvv`
* Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S recordmydesktop`
