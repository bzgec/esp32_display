* On Arch Linux you can install it with: `paru -S kibot-git`
** You may need to install `pcbdraw-git` in case of
`module 'pcbnew' has no attribute 'PLOTTEXTMODE_STROKE'` error
(try to run `pcbnew --version` to be sure that program runs correctly)
** You also may need to install `imagemagick`: `sudo pacman -S imagemagick`
** You also may need to install few `pip` packages: `pip install mistune pybars3 wand`
